This repository contains a simple Python function that demonstrates a common runtime error: ZeroDivisionError. The function `my_function` calculates the reciprocal of a given number.  However, it lacks proper error handling for the case where the input is zero.  The `bug.py` file shows the code that produces this error. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.py`, addresses this by adding a check for zero before performing division.
